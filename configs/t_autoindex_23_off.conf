# TEST: autoindex off explicitly
# PURPOSE:
# - Some resolvers only toggle when "on" and ignore "off".
# EXPECT:
# - Either validator rejects (if only "on" allowed),
# - OR runtime shows Autoindex: off / or simply doesn't print "Autoindex: on".
# - Most important: it must NOT accidentally turn it on.
