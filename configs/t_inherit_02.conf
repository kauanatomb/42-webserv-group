# TEST: Server → Location inheritance
# PURPOSE:
# - Server sets root and index.
# - Location /x sets nothing.
# - Resolver should inherit server root/index into /x.
#
# EXPECT:
# - Location /x root: /srv/site
# - Location /x index: a.html, b.html
# - client_max_body_size stays default 1048576 (unless set elsewhere)


server {
  listen 8080;
  root /srv/site;
  index a.html b.html;
