# TEST: location specificity sorting (longest/most specific first)
# PURPOSE:
# - Define overlapping location prefixes: /, /files, /files/images
# - Resolver should order locations by specificity so request matching works correctly.
#
# EXPECT (runtime print order):
# 1) /files/images
# 2) /files
# 3) /
#
# (If you sort differently, the runtime router could match / first and never reach the specific one.)
